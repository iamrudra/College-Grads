## Correlation between real estate and the equities market

Some of the strongest held beliefs is that real estate
* Has a higher rate of return that equities
* Is more recession resistant 
* Does not correlate with the stock market

So, I got interested in real estate investing.  I’ll tell you right now, it’s a very complicated topic, and I’m going to spend a lot of time trying to explain it (which will be useful, because maybe then I’ll actually understand it).   But, I wanted to see if any of this held up in the data.

It turns out, finding data on these things for long periods of time, is kind of hard.  For the stock market, if you only use a market index, you lose the value of dividends, which really depresses its value.  For real estate, there are so many different varieties that haven’t all been around for long periods of time, so it’s nearly impossible to have a truly long-term view.  But, I made a credible attempt at it, and here is what I have:

## Data
* Stock market:  Good news here is that the economist Robert Shiller has done the heavy lifting here, so this data is available for a very long period of time. (Shiller, 2018)
** Problem with this data:  US equities only.  
* Real estate:  This is a hard problem, and in the end my best long-term data was for Single Family Homes (SFH), from Robert Shiller in his book, Irrational Exuberance. (Shiller, 2018)
** Problem with this data:  Well, it makes SFH a proxy for all types of real estate. It is likely not 100% true when compared with Commercial and Multi-Family Home (MFH) and Retail and … but it’s the best I could find.

## Result

There is a lot going on in this chart, so I’ll try to summarize:
* Solid red line: Real estate value
* Dotted red line:  Trend line showing the slope (and thus the rate of return)
* Solid blue line: Stock market value
* Dotted blue line:  You should be able to figure this out.

So, what does it tell us:
* Historical rate of return since 1890
* Stock market: 7.2%
* Real estate: 6.9%
* Correlation between stock market and real estate: .70 (strong correlation)
* Volatility:  Clearly much lower for real estate

So, clearly the conclusion is that you should not invest in real estate, right?

Not so fast.  This is one of those cases where it’s not a simple decision, so you’re going to have to put your thinking tuque on.

## Positives
* Diversification:  It is a very good idea to be diversified.  This has the effect of limiting your risk by spreading it across many asset classes.  I’ll discuss diversification in more detail.
* Taxes:  Real estate can have a very large tax advantage.  Generally speaking they can be income generating, but with depreciation, show appreciable tax losses.  So, if you’re in high tax brackets it can bump the effective return up dramatically.

## Negatives
* Complexity:  It’s a very complex asset class.  We’ve already talked about SFH, MFH, Commercial and Retail.  But even there, you get Mobile Home Parks (MHP), Self-storage, Apartments, Medical, … the list goes on and on.
* Deal flow:  In recent years the availability of crowd funding has helped here dramatically.  Before that you had no way to get access to real estate in any truly sustainable and diverse way.
* Capital:  The owners are paying you to use your capital, which means you need to provide it.  The minimum investments tend to be $10,000 and realistically tend to be $25,000 and up.
* Liquidity:  Hold times are normally longer than 5 years, so you have to realize you’re giving up access to that money for the entire time.
Uncertainty:  It’s a new asset class to you, and due to the long hold times, you can’t go ‘full cycle’ before investing more money.

## TBD

### Correlation between REIT and SFH
### Taxes
### K1s are going to complicate things
