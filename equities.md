# Investing

Saving now will set you up for the future in a way you can't make up for later.  Plus I want you to think nice thoughts about me when you retire.  :)  You especially want to do this due to the [power of compounding](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazing-power-of-compound-interest-2014-7)!  You're young.  Take advantage of that long time horizon to make future you love past you.

I haven't looked in detail recently at what we can do through our plan, but this would be a good way to allocate your investments in the 401k.

Finally, watch these videos:

* [Boring Videos](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy)

Yes, they're more than a little boring.  Sorry about that.  But I really believe if you follow these concepts you will be super successful financially and prevent people from taking advantage of you in your financial life (and trust me, plenty of people will try).

**Never Forget!**

Investing is ALWAYS going to be trade-off of two things (plus another):
* Risk
* Return

The higher the risk, the greater the potential return, and vise-versa.
If someone tries to sell you something that is low-risk and high return, walk away.

The other thing that also comes into play is liquidity.  In particular think about things like real-estate which can't be quickly sold, versus cash which doesn't need to be sold.

## What should I invest in?

You should invest in the assets that aren't going to make you a nervous wreck.  Different people have different tolerances for risk.  

* Index funds

Yes.  These have low fees and if you choose the standard stock indices (S&P500, Large Cap, etc...) they have historically good returns.

* Target date

Also yes.  These work by you setting a date that you expect to want to get the money.  They will automatically rebalance the portfolio over time from high return investments to low risk investments so that you get the advantages of growth with planned stability at the end.
* Low fees

When in doubt, choose the options with low fees.  Fees come straight off of your return.  Thus a fund that is under .25% will perform significantly better than one that is 2% because of math.

### Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)
You should do this!  But I cover it in more in-depth in the [ESPP documentation](espp.md).
